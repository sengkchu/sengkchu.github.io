Hi! My name is Seng Kin Chu, and I am currently a data scientist at Dayforce. I am passionate about learning and I strive to improve myself every single day.

I started this blog in 2018 as a complete beginner (you can probably tell by the code). However, the purpose of this website is to provide educational content on data science to myself and to other learners. It is also a way for me to document my data science journey. In this blog, I try to explain various concepts in data science by coding using real-world datasets and examples. For me, the best way to understand a concept is to explain it to someone else.

Hope you enjoy the content!
