My personal blog built using Chirpy. Check out the Chirpy documentation [here](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/wiki).


#### Creating a blog post:

Simply add additional markdown files in `_posts/`. For attaching images in your blog post, you add the image files in `posts_images/` then link them in the markdown file.

#### Configuration:

See `_config.yml`
